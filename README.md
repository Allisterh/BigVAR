BigVAR
======

Dimension Reduction Methods for Multivariate Time Series


For a demonstration of the package's capabilities, see the user guide available [on Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07094).  The shiny app has been taken offline, but the source code is available upon request.

Note: This package utilizes C++11, so it requires a compiler with C++11 support (which should include most modern compilers) and a later version of R (version 3.1 is the oldest that I can confirm works).

To install BigVAR, after installing the devtools package, run the following commands

```R
library(devtools)

install_github("wbnicholson/BigVAR/BigVAR")
```
